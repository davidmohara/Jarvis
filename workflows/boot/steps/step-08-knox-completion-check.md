# Step 08: Knox Completion Check (Background Task Monitoring)

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

1. Knox was spawned fire-and-forget in step-01 to process plaud-ingest workflow.
2. You MUST check its final status before marking boot complete.
3. Recording Knox's completion is informational — boot completion does not depend on Knox success.
4. You MUST log the outcome (success, failure, incomplete) so eval harness knows if background work finished.

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**Agent:** Master
**Input:** Knox eval record (if it exists in runs directory)
**Output:** Knox completion status recorded in frontmatter

---

## YOUR TASK

1. **Check for Knox eval record:**
   - Search `systems/eval-harness/runs/` for eval records matching:
     - `name: "plaud-ingest"` (or contains "knox")
     - `started` date matches current session (today)
     - Most recent record

2. **Determine status:**
   - If record found and `status: success`: Record "knox_completed_success"
   - If record found and `status: failure` or `status: partial`: Record "knox_completed_failure — [reason]"
   - If record found and `status: in_progress` or no completed time: Record "knox_still_running — background job still processing"
   - If no record found: Record "knox_no_eval_record — background job may not have started"

3. **Report Knox completion:**
   - Do NOT halt boot even if Knox failed — it's fire-and-forget background work
   - Surface Knox status to David as informational note in step output
   - If Knox escalated (has punch_out_signal), note that separately

4. **Update frontmatter:**
   ```yaml
   outputs:
     knox_status: "success" | "failure" | "still_running" | "no_record"
     knox_reason: "[detail about why]"
     knox_duration_seconds: N (if available)
     knox_eval_id: "[eval record ID]" (if found)
   ```

---

## Success Metrics

- Step checks for Knox eval record (success if attempted, regardless of result)
- Knox status is recorded (success, failure, running, or not_found)
- Boot completion is not blocked by Knox status

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Knox eval record not found | Record "no_record" and continue. This is normal if Knox hasn't finished yet. |
| Knox status = in_progress | Record "still_running" and continue. Boot complete, Knox finishing in background. |
| Knox status = failure | Record failure reason. Continue boot. Note to David that plaud-ingest hit an issue. |
| Eval file read fails | Record "eval_read_error" and continue. Non-blocking. |

---

## NEXT STEP

Read and follow: `step-07-verify-completion.md` (this runs BEFORE step-08, so verify completion happens first, then Knox check).

Actually, step-08 runs AFTER step-07 (completion gate). After Knox status is recorded here, boot is fully complete.

---

## Implementation Notes

This step is added to close the loop on Knox background processing. Since Knox is fire-and-forget, its status doesn't block boot, but we want to record whether the background job finished successfully so:

1. Eval harness has complete picture (Knox eval + Boot eval both present)
2. David knows if plaud-ingest succeeded or needs manual intervention
3. Next session can see that prior background work is complete (or still running)
