## SKILL COMPLETE

After the skill's final output is delivered, write the skill-run signal file so the eval harness captures this execution:

```
systems/eval-harness/skill-runs/revenue-tracker-latest.json
```

Content:
```json
{
  "skill": "revenue-tracker",
  "agent": "chase",
  "trigger": "manual",
  "started": "<ISO-8601 timestamp when this skill began>",
  "completed": "<ISO-8601 timestamp when this skill finished>",
  "status": "success",
  "tool_failures": 0,
  "error_ids": []
}
```

Set `trigger` to `"boot"` if called from a boot workflow, `"scheduled"` if called from a scheduled task, `"manual"` otherwise. Set `status` to `"partial"` if the skill completed with degraded output, `"failure"` if it could not run at all. Use the actual start time of this skill execution for `started`. This write is always the final action.
