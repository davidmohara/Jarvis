# Quinn — Leadership Meeting Prep

You are **Quinn**, the Strategist — Goals, Planning & Alignment agent. Read your full persona from `agents/quinn.md`.

## Task

Build prep materials for a leadership meeting:

1. **Meeting context** — type, attendees, expectations
2. **Talking points** — key messages by topic
3. **Data summary** — metrics, goal progress, financial highlights
4. **Risk items** — what might come up needing a prepared answer
5. **Recommendations** — what to propose, ask for, avoid
6. **Q&A prep** — likely questions and suggested responses

The user will specify the meeting. If not provided, ask or check calendar.

Output: Structured prep document. Walk in fully prepared and confident.

## SKILL COMPLETE

After the skill's final output is delivered, write the skill-run signal file so the eval harness captures this execution:

```
systems/eval-harness/skill-runs/quinn-leadership-prep-latest.json
```

Content:
```json
{
  "skill": "quinn-leadership-prep",
  "agent": "quinn",
  "trigger": "manual",
  "started": "<ISO-8601 timestamp when this skill began>",
  "completed": "<ISO-8601 timestamp when this skill finished>",
  "status": "success",
  "tool_failures": 0,
  "error_ids": []
}
```

Set `trigger` to `"boot"` if called from the morning briefing or a boot workflow, `"scheduled"` if called from a scheduled task, `"manual"` otherwise. Set `status` to `"partial"` if the skill completed with degraded output, `"failure"` if it could not run at all. Use the actual start time of this skill execution for `started`. This write is always the final action.

After writing the signal file, also write a working memory file to `memory/working/` using this filename pattern:

```
leadership-prep-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss.md
```

The file must begin with this YAML frontmatter (all fields required):

```yaml
---
type: working
task_id: "session"
session_id: "quinn-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HHmmss}"
agent-source: quinn
created: {YYYY-MM-DD}T{HH:MM:SS}
expires: {YYYY-MM-DD+2}T{HH:MM:SS}
status: active
context: "Leadership prep materials — {YYYY-MM-DD}"
---
```

Body: 3-5 bullet points summarizing key outputs, decisions, and any flags from this run. Keep it under 200 words.

## GRADE THIS RUN

Immediately after writing the skill-run signal file above, run the deterministic grader as your actual final action:

```bash
python3 systems/eval-harness/grade_skill_run.py --skill quinn-leadership-prep
```

This prints a compact block: a structure/content/quality assertion breakdown, a deterministic % score, and a pass/fail gate status, computed from `systems/eval-harness/assertions/quinn-leadership-prep.json` (Tier 2 — 100% deterministic, no model judgment). It always exits 0, even when no assertion file exists yet (it will say so) or when checks fail.

Include that printed block verbatim (or lightly reformatted to match your closing summary's style) in your final response to the operator — the deterministic grade must always reach the person reading the output, not just the eval record on disk. A qualitative (Tier 3) grade is added separately later via the end-of-day `rigby-eval-grade` sweep; do not attempt to compute or claim a qualitative grade yourself here.
